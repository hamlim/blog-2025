### Update!

I did in fact come back to writing about pair programming in
[this blog post](/2023/november/pair-programming), give it a read and let me
know what you think!

Note: This is a subbed article, I may come back and write a bit about pair
programming in the future, but for now I'd recommend giving my [post on Pair Code Reviews](/2020/december/pair-code-reviews) a
read if you haven't yet!
