If you have a multi-step form and you want to allow the user to go back a step _without writing client side JS to manage the current step_, you can use another `type="submit"` button with a special `name`, `value`, and importantly `formNoValidate` attributes:

```html
<button
  type="submit"
  // this can be any value you want
  name="back"
  // again can be any value you want
  value="true"
  // ✨✨✨
  // allow form submissions even if there are required form fields
  // not currently filled in
  // ✨✨✨
  formNoValidate
>
  Go Back
</button>
```

This tip works with plain old HTML forms, and can also work with React forms (server actions/functions, server components, etc)!
