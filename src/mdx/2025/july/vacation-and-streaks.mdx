I've been on vacation the past week and we still have another week of the trip remaining as well. It's been a great trip so far - I'll have to do a longer write up of the whole thing<FootnoteRef id="1">Although thats what I say about every trip for the past few years and I still haven't written up any posts about them either! But this one will be different!</FootnoteRef>.

At the same time I've been attempting to get a GitHub contribution every day for the rest of the year - now I know that this sounds silly, the little green squares on my profile aren't real indicators of anything - however it feels nice building on a long term habit of working on things on the side.

Unfortunately, I didn't get a contribution in yesterday (July 6th), which I think is the first missed day after about a 119 days of contributions! However it's not the end of the world to miss a single day, I'll just have to start a new streak starting today!
