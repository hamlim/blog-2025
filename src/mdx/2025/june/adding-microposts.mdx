I'm working on adding short-form (microblog-like) status updates (`microposts`) to my personal website.

It's not fully flushed (or fleshed?) out yet, so this may change in the near future!

I may not use these updates as much - but it seems like a nice low-friction way to share quick thoughts.

Next step is to build a mini web app to easily post them though!
