The title basically says it all - if you manage docs (specifically a documentation website), your docs should show the date and time of when the docs were created and last updated.

I'm sure most of us have been looking at some docs for a library or feature and then find out later through experimentation or when talking with coworkers that those docs are at least 6+ months out of date.

Add a quick timestamp at the top of the page showing when the docs were created (and also add one for when the docs were last updated)!
