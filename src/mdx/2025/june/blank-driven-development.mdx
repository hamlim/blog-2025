I've been collecting a personal note of various **"____ Driven Development"** patterns, I figured I'd share them here to help others adopt them!

<Callout>

Hint - I don't actually strongly recommend some of these patterns ðŸ¤£

</Callout>

- Domain (name) Driven Development
  - Buying a domain name to motivate you to actually build something
  - Rarely ever works
- Meme Driven Development
  - "Building it for the meme"
- Readme Driven Development
  - Outlining how the thing should work in the readme, and then implementing it from there
  - May actually work really well
- CI Driven Development
  - Slinging code changes to remote to see if the CI passes or fails
  - It usually fails at least couple of times, don't worry about trying to find the root issue locally, just keep pushing changes!
