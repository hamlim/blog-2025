For a while now I've been tweaking my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) setup and leaning more and more into using the [Dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) to create dynamic sections or notes within my vault.

Recently I've been re-using mostly the same snippet over and over to create quick access summary or roundup notes within my vault and I figured I'd share it for others to use if they find it useful!

### Requirements:

This setup only requires the [Dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).

### Implementation:

The snippet that I've continued to re-use has been the following:

~~~md
```dataviewjs
let pages = dv.pages('<query>');

// Optional - this reverses the order of notes
// sorting from most recent to oldest based on file created time
// but this can be replaced with other logic to sort based
// on properties or other aspects of the pages!
let sortedPages = pages.values.toSorted((a, b) => a.file.ctime > b.file.ctime ? -1 : 1);

// "rendering" logic of the snippet
// renders effectively a list of links and embeds for each page
for (let page of sortedPages) {
  dv.paragraph(`[[${page.file.path}]]`)
  dv.paragraph(`![[${page.file.path}]]`)
}
```
~~~

The `<query>` can be replaced with effectively anything that you want to match on - it can be file paths/folders or tags (e.g. `#meeting`). See the [`dv.pages(source)` docs](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/#dvpagessource) for more details.

<Callout>

You can swap `dv.pages()` out for `await dv.query()` for a bit more control over the content that you query for, however the resulting value will be a different shape - so the sorting and rendering logic may need to change!

</Callout>

### Examples:

In practice, I've used this for a few different use cases:

- A single note to see recurring 1-on-1 meeting notes with a specific individual
	- I've found this to be easier to scan for the previous iteration of the 1-on-1 and see if there are any topics I need to follow up on
- A roundup note for `#self-reflection` notes
	- Every so often I take some zettel-like notes adding some top of mind reflections on how I've been doing / how productive I've been / etc - so now I have a single roundup of those notes that I can scan through and come away with any deeper insights
- Daily note collection of Zettel-like notes
	- I now mostly take notes within "zettel-like" nodes (titled with a timestamp), so to connect them back to my daily notes I have used this pattern to render them all in order making it easier to see them all for a single day in one place
